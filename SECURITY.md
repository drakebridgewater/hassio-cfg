## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in my Home Assistant configuration, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until it has been addressed.

## Security Considerations

This repository contains configuration for a home automation system. While I try to follow security best practices, please note:

- Some sensitive information has been redacted using secret management
- My Home Assistant instance is not directly exposed to the internet and uses secure access methods
- I regularly review and update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities
