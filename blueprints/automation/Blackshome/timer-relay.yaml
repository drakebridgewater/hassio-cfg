  name: Timer Relay
  description: "# TIMER RELAY\nVersion: 1.2\n\nThe most common automation used for
    a Timer Relay (also known as a \"Run on Timer\"). Select a trigger and its desired
    state. Then set the delay time in seconds, minutes & 4 hours. The entity will
    turn OFF after the time period expires.\n\nFor community support see this forum

    \n\nGitHub: [Click Here](https://gist.github.com/Blackshome/495198096386f0db2cdaf91c0bda50ea)\n\nThe
    Automation Process:\n - When the trigger is activated, it turns the selected entity
    (lights, fan, motor etc.) ON and then OFF automatically in a pre-set time period.
    You can have as many triggers and entities as you like.\n - The entity will stay
    ON if the trigger has been activated again before the time delay turns the entity
    OFF. It will then reset the time delay after the last trigger event.\n \n **If
